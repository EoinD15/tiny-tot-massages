            <h2><u>The 6 Core Benefits of Baby Massage</u></h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Bonding</h3> Massage encourages positive bonding between parent and baby at an early stage. 
                    Spending intimate one on one time with your little one can help you get to know each other.</li>
                <li><h3>Confidence</h3>It can help you become more confident with handling your child and better at recognising her needs. 
                    Spending quiet time massaging your baby will give you the time and space you need to start recognising and learning her cues.</li>
                <li><h3>Boosts Baby's Health</h3>There are numerous physiological benefits of massage for your baby.
                    Massage can stimulate the many systems of the body such as the skin, digestive, nervous and respiratory systems.</li>
                <li><h3>Calming</h3>Massage is calming on the nervous system and is excellent for colic and sleep. Massaging raises levels 
                    of the 'feel-good' hormone oxytocin in both you and your baby, helping you both feel calmer and relaxed.</li>
                <li><h3>Relaxing</h3>Your baby's muscles relax, breathing becomes deeper and the massage oil nourishes your child's skin. 
                    Skin stimulation also provides a vital trigger to the nervous system.</li>
                <li><h3>Relief</h3>It can also provide relief â€“ massaging your baby's tummy, for example, 
                    can help ease colic, constipation or trapped wind.</li>
            </ol>
